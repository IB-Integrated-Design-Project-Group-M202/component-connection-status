# component-connection-status
### Tests the Connection Status of each Component on the Arduino Uno Wi-Fi Rev 2 Board

### Must be uploaded and ran before the robot enters the arena for the competition

### Remember to upload the Competition code subsequently

This repository contains the individual test functions, necessary to ensure that the different components are connected in an appropriate manner, before the start of the competition. This ensures that any component connection issues can be de-bugged before the beginning of the competition.

All test functions provided here can be uploaded to the board individually, to test each component in isolation with relative ease. Refer to the descriptions provided at the start of each file, to configure the circuits appropriately for the best test results.
